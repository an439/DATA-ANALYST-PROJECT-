-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- the null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal. I don't think I want to change that
-- I like having them null because it makes it easier for calculations during the EDA phase

-- so there isn't anything I want to change with the null values

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL

-- Here we are jsut going to explore the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers

-- by location
SELECT location, SUM(total_laid_off)

-- this it total in the past 3 years or in the dataset
