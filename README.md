# EMPLOYEE LAYOFF ANALYSIS-PROJECT-

 The data cleaning process has successfully addressed issues such as duplicates, inconsistencies, and null values in the employee layoff dataset. By performing these operations, I have ensured that the dataset is now prepared for further analysis, such as trend analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, to gain valuable insights into the impact of layoffs on different industries, countries, and stages of companies.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided valuable insights into the employee layoff dataset for the year 2022. By analyzing various aspects such as company layoffs, industry trends, geographical distribution, and temporal patterns, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. These insights can inform further analysis and decision-making processes related to workforce management, industry trends, and economic impacts.
